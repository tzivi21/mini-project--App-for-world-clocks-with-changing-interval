# React + Vite
This project is an app showcasing three clocks for different cities (Jerusalem, London, New York City). Each clock updates based on a customizable time interval. Users can control these intervals collectively or for each clock individually. The app uses useEffect to manage the clock updates and includes challenges like adding new clocks or removing existing ones.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
